Wrote tests for the first time from ground up -> simpler than expected
Nice setup with template I can improve and then copy-paste with few overhead 
Overhead of setting up a new project for each day is way to much overhead, will setup one last one for the rest of the days
Working more with classes and constructors
Some linq (for input splitting and such)
Refactoring
Passing a function as argument
