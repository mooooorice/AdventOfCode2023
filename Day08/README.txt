Todo:
Run Part 2?

Done:
Find out why it does not complete?
    It finds the node named ZZZ in the dictionary -> so it should be there
    It seems to find all nodes -> no input missing at the end
    It has the same first letters as the original input -> no input is missing at the top
    Startname is always "AAA", not the first 3 letter part
